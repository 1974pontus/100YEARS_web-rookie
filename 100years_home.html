        <h1>100 YEARS</h1>
        <p>
          A 100 years is about how long we humans can grasp the time given to us
          on this planet. There are people that live for longer than that and
          can actually remember what happend 100 years ago. think about that...
        </p>
        <p>
          The Swedish indie-metal act 100 YEARS was formed back in 2012. The
          members are all regular forty-something guys with a slightly
          extraordinary background in music; ranging from death metal pioneering
          in the ground breaking band Merciless to Swedish household punk rock
          band Dia Psalma. What brought these random pieces together was the
          soft spot for mood as well as noise.<br />When you accidentally hit
          that nerve, that open wound, that resonates with your actual bones.
          That is the monment we are constantly searching for. And when you can
          transcend that thing to the listener you are on to something huge.
          Lyric-wise the subjects describes the darkness, loneliness and
          emptiness that evolves around us, the humans. The music itself can be
          boiled down to three words: pretention, soul and monotony. Voivod
          meets Swans, or Killing Joke meets Celtic Frost – well, let your ears
          decide.

        <h3>SUICIDE RECORDS</h3>
        <p>
          The finest recordlabel that ever came out of this god forsaken cold
          part of the world. Tons of excellent releases from them. I all started
          with the love for extreme and ugly music. Two great friends Roger and
          Henrik took things in their own hands created the label. Now it has
          grown and even has an office in Finland that also releases strange and
          dark noises from the finnish underground. Noise and thunder and always
          with an artistic edge to all their signed acts. You should really
          check them out. It´s an order.

          >We are currently planning to take over europe in the fall of 2019.
          And the process of recording and writing new stuff for album nr. 2 is
          in full bloom. Just a few gigs here in sweden this spring, only to try
          out new songs and to keep our limbs fit all the time. Stay tuned for
          some big announcements very soon. And be shure to follow us on all
          your favorit social media.</P

          <b>Uppdate on the upcomming recording:</b><br />Song are pretty much
          written and pre-production is in full progress. It´s a little bit
          tricky to get all all of us together since we all have other jobs and
          family´s to attend. And the fact that we live in totally different
          parts of this cold and god forsaken country. But do not fear, things
          will fall into place pretty soon. <br />
